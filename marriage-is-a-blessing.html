    <h1>A Defense For Marriage</h1>
    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section>
        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to be an encouragement and a defense for those of us who want to find a 
            spouse, by examining what is plainly stated in the scriptures concerning human sexuality.  There are those 
            in the church today that teach that sexual attraction is not an important part of marriage, but if you read 
            the scriptures, it is integral to a healthy marriage.  It is critical that we as believers recognize and 
            respect God's design for marriage -- the welfare of our spouses, our children, and the church as a whole 
            depends on it.
        </p>
        <p>The following passages are referenced in this letter:</p>
        <p>
            Genesis 2:18-24
            <br/>Deuteronomy 20:7
            <br/>Deuteronomy 24:5

            but I encourage you to read the Bible and see for yourself.

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Marriage has been an institution since people were first created and will be around until the world ends.
            It is for this life only (while we are mortal).
        </p>
        <p>Marriage is God-ordained, from the beginning.  Let us consider these verses in Genesis 2:</p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>18</strong> Yahweh God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper 
            comparable to him." <strong>19</strong> Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and 
            every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called 
            every living creature became its name. <strong>20</strong> The man gave names to all livestock, and to the 
            birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to 
            him. <strong>21</strong> Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one 
            of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. <strong>22</strong> Yahweh God made a woman from the rib 
            which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. <strong>23</strong> The man said, "This is 
            now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of Man." 
            <strong>24</strong> Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and 
            they will be one flesh. - Genesis 2:18-24
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see that God recognized that it was not good for Adam to be alone, so He made him a helper, who was
            female, and she became his wife.  We can also see from these verses that this doesn't just apply to Adam,
            it applies to everyone.  Though we are not under the law but under grace, let us consider what God says in
            the law concerning marriage:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>7</strong> What man is there who has pledged to be married to a wife, and has not taken her? Let him
            go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her." - Deuteronomy 20:7 
            (referring to Israelites who were about to do battle with their enemies)
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>5</strong> When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be 
            assigned any business. He shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken. 
            - Deuteronomy 24:5
        </p>
        <p>
            God recognized marriage as something very important, so much so that He made a law against sending newly
            married men into battle.  During His time on Earth, while being tested by the Pharisees, Jesus reaffirmed
            God's design for marriage:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>3</strong> Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his 
            wife for any reason?"
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>4</strong> He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male
            and female, ... <strong>5</strong> and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and 
            mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?' ... <strong>6</strong>
            So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear 
            apart." - Matthew 19:3-6
        </p>
        <p>
            In that it is to be between one man and one woman, and because the man and his wife became one flesh, it is
            not something that man should separate.  Paul also counsels young widows to remarry, which further affirms
            that marriage is something that is God-ordained up to today.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>14</strong> I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and
            give no occasion to the adversary for insulting. <strong>15</strong> For already some have turned away after
            Satan. <strong>16</strong> If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't let
            the assembly be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows indeed. - 1 Timothy 5:14-16
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see that marriage is, and has always been, God ordained for while we are here on Earth.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>34</strong> Jesus said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage. 
            <strong>35</strong> But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the 
            dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. <strong>36</strong> For they can't die any more, for they are 
            like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. - Luke 20:34-36
        </p>

    <!-- MARRIAGE IS A BLESSING -->
    <section>
        <h2>Marriage is a Blessing</h2>
        <p>
            Marriage is a gift to us.  It is a great thing when someone who desires to get married is able to do so and
            enjoy the blessings.  It is a terrible thing when someone who desires to get married is unable to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            As proof that a healthy marriage is a blessing, let us consider a few of the things the woman in the Song of
            Solomon said.  Many times, the years preceding marriage are years of hardship and loneliness.  We as a
            church can help make those years easier for one another by encouraging each other.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <br/><strong>5</strong> I am dark, but lovely,
            <br/>you daughters of Jerusalem,
            <br/>like Kedar's tents,
            <br/>like Solomon's curtains.
            <br/><strong>6</strong> Don't stare at me because I am dark,
            <br/>because the sun has scorched me.
            <br/>My mother's sons were angry with me.
            <br/>They made me keeper of the vineyards.
            <br/>I haven't kept my own vineyard.
            <br/><strong>7</strong> Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
            <br/>where you graze your flock,
            <br/>where you rest them at noon;
            <br/>for why should I be as one who is veiled
            <br/>beside the flocks of your companions? - 1:5-7
        </p>
        <p>
            Marriage is a blessing -- for some, the years of loneliness and hardship are drawing to a close.  If we
            choose to pursue a spouse, we get to be a part of this story.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>10</strong> My beloved spoke, and said to me,
            <br/>"Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
            <br/><strong>11</strong> For behold, the winter is past.
            <br/>The rain is over and gone.
            <br/><strong>12</strong> The flowers appear on the earth.
            <br/>The time of the singing has come,
            <br/>and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
            <br/><strong>13</strong> The fig tree ripens her green figs.
            <br/>The vines are in blossom.
            <br/>They give out their fragrance.
            <br/>Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
            <br/>and come away." - 2:10-13
        </p>
        <p>
            Love is more valuable than any amount of wealth and with it there is fierce jealousy:  the man is jealous
            for the woman and the woman is jealous for the man.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>6</strong> Set me as a seal on your heart,
            <br/>as a seal on your arm;
            <br/>for love is strong as death.
            <br/>Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
            <br/>Its flashes are flashes of fire,
            <br/>a very flame of Yahweh.
            <br/><strong>7</strong> Many waters can't quench love,
            <br/>neither can floods drown it.
            <br/>If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
            <br/>he would be utterly scorned. - 8:6-7
        </p>
        <p>
            This pictures Christ and His Church because God is a Jealous God.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who desire the blessings of marriage, it's a tragedy when they are denied.  Let us consider the
            account of Jephthah's tragic vow:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>29</strong> Then Yahweh's Spirit came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of
            Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>30</strong> Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, "If you will indeed deliver the children of 
            Ammon into my hand, <strong>31</strong> then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house 
            to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up 
            for a burnt offering."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>32</strong> So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh 
            delivered them into his hand. <strong>33</strong> He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even 
            twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued 
            before the children of Israel.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>34</strong> Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with
            tambourines and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter. 
            <strong>35</strong> When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me 
            very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go 
            back."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>36</strong> She said to him, "My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to
            that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even
            on the children of Ammon." <strong>37</strong> Then she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me. 
            Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my
            companions."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>38</strong> He said, "Go." He sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her 
            companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains. <strong>39</strong> At the end of two months, she 
            returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. She was a virgin. It 
            became a custom in Israel <strong>40</strong> that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the 
            daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
            - Judges 11:29-40
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice how Jephthah's daughter wept for her virginity for two months before Jephthah offered her up to God
            as a burnt offering?  Had the Lord thought that her dying a virgin wasn't tragic, He wouldn't have
            reiterated that "She had never known a man" or mentioned the custom in Israel that resulted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The account of Rachel and Leah:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>31</strong> Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 
            <strong>32</strong> Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, "Because Yahweh 
            has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me." <strong>33</strong> She conceived again, and 
            bore a son, and said, "Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also." 
            She named him Simeon. <strong>34</strong> She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, "Now this time my 
            husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore his name was called Levi. 
            <strong>35</strong> She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, "This time I will praise Yahweh." 
            Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing. - Genesis 29:31-35
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice how Rachel was loved and Leah was hated, though they were both married?  It is by design that
            individuals in a marriage love each other.  This story shows that it is a terrible thing when someone is
            unloved in a marriage, and that this is not according to God's design.
        </p>
        <p>
            To end this on a better note, consider the account of Isaac and Rebekah (see Genesis 24):
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>62</strong> Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South. 
            <strong>63</strong> Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and 
            looked. Behold, there were camels coming. <strong>64</strong> Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw 
            Isaac, she got off the camel. <strong>65</strong> She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking 
            in the field to meet us?"
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            The servant said, "It is my master."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            She took her veil, and covered herself. <strong>66</strong> The servant told Isaac all the things that he 
            had done. <strong>67</strong> Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she 
            became his wife. He loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death. - Genesis 24:62-67
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice how Isaac loved Rebekah?  Also, how God included the part about Isaac being comforted after his
            mother's death?  It is by design that marriage be a blessing to each one of us who desire it.  But for
            those of us who have no desire for this blessing, there is another way of going about life...

    <!-- EUNUCHS FOR GOD'S KINGDOM -->
    <section>
        <h2>Eunuchs For God's Kingdom</h2>
        <p>There are certain advantages to not marrying.  Paul describes some of the advantages in 1 Corinthians 7:</p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as
            one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy. <strong>26</strong> Therefore I think that
            because of the distress that is on us, that it's good for a man to remain as he is. <strong>27</strong> Are
            you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don't seek a wife.
            <strong>28</strong> But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such
            will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you. <strong>29</strong> But I say this, brothers:
            the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;
            <strong>30</strong> and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they
            didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess; <strong>31</strong> and those who use the
            world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away. <strong>32</strong> But I
            desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how
            he may please the Lord; <strong>33</strong> but he who is married is concerned about the things of the
            world, how he may please his wife. <strong>34</strong> There is also a difference between a wife and a
            virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in
            spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world--how she may please her husband.
            <strong>35</strong> This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is
            appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction. - 1 Corinthians 7:25-35
        </p>
        <p>
            Not getting married helps a person be undivided in his or her devotion to the Lord and not be anxious about
            worldly things (pleasing the other person).  It is important for us to realize that having no desire to
            marry is a gift from God, not something forced on an individual, and that a person who does marry does not
            sin:

            <strong>6</strong> But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment. <strong>7</strong> Yet I wish
            that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of
            that kind. - 1 Corinthians 7:6-7
        </p>
        <p>
            There are other scriptures that say the same thing.  At one point in His ministry, Jesus was tested by the
            Pharisees concerning divorce:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>3</strong> Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his
            wife for any reason?"
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>4</strong> He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male
            and female, ... <strong>5</strong> and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and
            mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?' ... <strong>6</strong>
            So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear 
            apart."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>7</strong> They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and
            divorce her?"
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>8</strong> He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce
            your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. <strong>9</strong> I tell you that whoever divorces
            his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when
            she is divorced commits adultery." - Matthew 19:3-9
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the grounds for divorce is sexual immorality by one of the individuals (see Deuteronomy
            22:13-30 for examples of sexual immorality.  If an unbelieving spouse deserts a believer, the believer
            may remarry, see 1 Corinthians 7:15).  When the disciples heard this, they were shocked, but Jesus
            used this as an opportunity to lay an important principle, which is the same as what Paul said:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>10</strong> His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not 
            expedient to marry."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>11</strong> But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is 
            given. <strong>12</strong> For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there 
            are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom 
            of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it." - Matthew 19:10-12
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea that "it is better not to marry" is for those who can receive it, and it is a gift from God.  But
            not all of us have that gift.  For those who don't have the gift, being able to fall in love and get married
            is a tremendous blessing, and not being able to fall in love or get married is a tragedy.

    <!-- SEX IN MARRIAGE -->
    <section>
        <h2>Sex In Marriage</h2>
        <p>
            It is good not to have the desire to marry.  But many people don't have this gift.  Let us consider what
            Paul has to say on this:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
            <strong>2</strong> But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman
            have her own husband. <strong>3</strong> Let the husband give his wife the affection owed her, and likewise
            also the wife her husband. <strong>4</strong> The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the
            husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife.
            <strong>5</strong> Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give
            yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your
            lack of self-control. - 1 Corinthians 7:1-5
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from being lonely, another valid reason for marrying is because people have sexual desire for each
            other.  As Paul states here, having sexual desire outside of marriage is a temptation to sin, but can be
            dealt with by spouses giving one another their conjugal rights, and not depriving one another except for a
            limited time.  Because sex is to be enjoyed in a marriage, the church should respect the right of people
            who have sexual desire to find significant others, fall in love, get married, and enjoy their marriages, so
            that they are not constantly tempted to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us consider a couple of the images in the Song of Solomon which portray sex in a positive light:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <br/><strong>9</strong> You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
            <br/>You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,
            <br/>with one chain of your neck.
            <br/><strong>10</strong> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
            <br/>How much better is your love than wine,
            <br/>the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices!
            <br/><strong>11</strong> Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.
            <br/>Honey and milk are under your tongue.
            <br/>The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
            <br/><strong>12</strong> My sister, my bride, is a locked up garden;
            <br/>a locked up spring,
            <br/>a sealed fountain.
            <br/><strong>13</strong> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits,
            <br/>henna with spikenard plants,
            <br/><strong>14</strong> spikenard and saffron,
            <br/>calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree;
            <br/>myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,
            <br/><strong>15</strong> a fountain of gardens,
            <br/>a well of living waters,
            <br/>flowing streams from Lebanon.
            <br/>
            <br/><strong>Beloved</strong>
            <br/><strong>16</strong> Awake, north wind, and come, you south!
            <br/>Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out.
            <br/>Let my beloved come into his garden,
            <br/>and taste his precious fruits.
            <br/>Song of Solomon 4:9-16
        </p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>6</strong> How beautiful and how pleasant you are,
            <br/>love, for delights!
            <br/><strong>7</strong> This, your stature, is like a palm tree,
            <br/>your breasts like its fruit.
            <br/><strong>8</strong> I said, 'I will climb up into the palm tree.
            <br/>I will take hold of its fruit.'
            <br/>Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
            <br/>the smell of your breath like apples.
            <br/><strong>9</strong> Your mouth is like the best wine,
            <br/>that goes down smoothly for my beloved,
            <br/>gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
            <br/>
            <br/><strong>Beloved</strong>
            <br/><strong>10</strong> I am my beloved's.
            <br/>His desire is toward me.
            <br/>Song of Solomon 7:6-10
        </p>
        <p>
            Because these things are written in the scripture, we can conclude that they are from God.  While it is true
            that the Song of Solomon represents Christ and the Church, we can't ignore the fact that it applies to each
            one of us as well.  Our marriages symbolize the unity of Christ and the Church, and sex in our marriages is
            part of that symbol, by design.  If God thought that enjoying sex was evil, He wouldn't have included these
            things or any of the other imagery in the Song of Solomon.  We can see from other places in scripture that
            sexual desire is one of the things that leads to marriage:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>15</strong> Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for 
            nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>16</strong> Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger
            was Rachel. <strong>17</strong> Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. 
            <strong>18</strong> Jacob loved Rachel. He said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger 
            daughter."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>19</strong> Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another
            man. Stay with me."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>20</strong> Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he
            had for her.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>21</strong> Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to
            her." - Genesis 29:15-21
        </p>
        <p>
            It is evident from this story that Jacob looked at Rachel, saw that she was attractive, and had sexual
            desire for her.  It is also evident that God didn't have an issue with this; if He had, He would have said
            so right here.  Which leads to the next important point...

    <!-- ADULTERY -->
    <section>
        <h2>Adultery</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most serious offenses in the scripture is adultery.  Let us consider some what the scriptures 
            say:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>22</strong> If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both die,
            the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel. <strong>23</strong>
            If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man finds her in the
            city, and lies with her, <strong>24</strong> then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city,
            and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city; and the
            man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
            <strong>25</strong> But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man
            forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die; <strong>26</strong> but to the
            lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his
            neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter; <strong>27</strong> for he found her in the field, the 
            pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her. - Deuteronomy 22:22-27
        </p>
        <p>
            In all three cases, God's law says that the perpetrator(s) were to be put to death for their sin.  God also 
            says this concerning the adultery that was happening in the nation of Israel:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>7</strong> "How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what are no gods.
            When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the
            prostitutes' houses. <strong>8</strong> They were as fed horses roaming at large. Everyone neighed after
            his neighbor's wife. <strong>9</strong> Shouldn't I punish them for these things?" says Yahweh. "Shouldn't 
            my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? - Jeremiah 5:7-9
        </p>
        <p>
            Considering the fact that adultery was one of the things that brought about judgment on the nation of 
            Israel, it is no laughing matter.  Solomon gives this advice to his son:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>15</strong> Drink water out of your own cistern,
            <br/>running water out of your own well.
            <br/><strong>16</strong> Should your springs overflow in the streets,
            <br/>streams of water in the public squares?
            <br/><strong>17</strong> Let them be for yourself alone,
            <br/>not for strangers with you.
            <br/><strong>18</strong> Let your spring be blessed.
            <br/>Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
            <br/><strong>19</strong> A loving doe and a graceful deer--
            <br/>let her breasts satisfy you at all times.
            <br/>Be captivated always with her love.
            <br/><strong>20</strong> For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
            <br/>Why embrace the bosom of another?
            <br/><strong>21</strong> For the ways of man are before Yahweh's eyes.
            <br/>He examines all his paths.
            <br/><strong>22</strong> The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.
            <br/>The cords of his sin hold him firmly.
            <br/><strong>23</strong> He will die for lack of instruction.
            <br/>In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray. - Proverbs 5:15-23
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see very clearly from Solomon's advice that it is right in God's eyes when we're intoxicated with our
            own wife, but wrong when we're intoxicated with someone else's wife.  Solomon also says this concerning the 
            adulteress:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <br/><strong>20</strong> My son, keep your father's commandment,
            <br/>and don't forsake your mother's teaching.
            <br/><strong>21</strong> Bind them continually on your heart.
            <br/>Tie them around your neck.
            <br/><strong>22</strong> When you walk, it will lead you.
            <br/>When you sleep, it will watch over you.
            <br/>When you awake, it will talk with you.
            <br/><strong>23</strong> For the commandment is a lamp,
            <br/>and the law is light.
            <br/>Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
            <br/><strong>24</strong> to keep you from the immoral woman,
            <br/>from the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue.
            <br/><strong>25</strong> Don't lust after her beauty in your heart,
            <br/>neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
            <br/><strong>26</strong> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
            <br/>The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
            <br/><strong>27</strong> Can a man scoop fire into his lap,
            <br/>and his clothes not be burned?
            <br/><strong>28</strong> Or can one walk on hot coals,
            <br/>and his feet not be scorched?
            <br/><strong>29</strong> So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife.
            <br/>Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.
            <br/><strong>30</strong> Men don't despise a thief
            <br/>if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry;
            <br/><strong>31</strong> but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
            <br/>He shall give all the wealth of his house.
            <br/><strong>32</strong> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
            <br/>He who does it destroys his own soul.
            <br/><strong>33</strong> He will get wounds and dishonor.
            <br/>His reproach will not be wiped away.
            <br/><strong>34</strong> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.
            <br/>He won't spare in the day of vengeance.
            <br/><strong>35</strong> He won't regard any ransom,
            <br/>neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts. - Proverbs 6:20-35
        </p>
        <p>
            A person isn't just guilty when he commits adultery; he is also guilty when he wants to commit adultery.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>27</strong> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery;' ... 
            <strong>28</strong> but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed 
            adultery with her already in his heart. <strong>29</strong> If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck 
            it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish
            than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. <strong>30</strong> If your right hand causes you to 
            stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members 
            should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. - Matthew 5:27-30
        </p>
        <p>
            Jesus used the word 'adultery' because he was referring to the sin of 'adultery', as defined in other places
            in the scripture.  As shown by all the verses previously quoted, God is not against unmarried people being 
            attracted to each other.  However, He hates the sin of adultery.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Exodus:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>14</strong> "You shall not commit adultery. - 20:14
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>17</strong> "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, 
            nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your 
            neighbor's." - 20:17
        </p>
        <p>
            In Deuteronomy:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>18</strong> "You shall not commit adultery. - 5:18
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>21</strong> "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbor's 
            house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is 
            your neighbor's."
            - 5:21
        </p>
        <p>
            From the law, it is evident that the intent of the command:  "You shall not commit adultery" was that we 
            don't even covet our neighbor's wife.  When we look at someone else's wife with lustful intent, we're 
            coveting her because we're intent on having sex with her.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's obvious that Jesus isn't talking to an unmarried person who is attracted to another unmarried person.  
            As further proof, let us consider what God says in the Law:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>10</strong> When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into 
            your hands and you carry them away captive, <strong>11</strong> and see among the captives a beautiful 
            woman, and you are attracted to her, and desire to take her as your wife, <strong>12</strong> then you shall
            bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails. <strong>13</strong> She shall 
            take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother
            a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. 
            <strong>14</strong> It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires;
            but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have 
            humbled her. - Deuteronomy 21:10-14
        </p>
        <p>
            Had God thought that seeing a beautiful woman and desiring that she would become your wife is sinful, there 
            would have been some type of punishment or sacrifice required.  As with Isaiah and Jacob and everyone else 
            in the Bible, this wasn't the case here.

            <br/>Behold, you are beautiful.
            <br/>Your eyes are like doves behind your veil.
            <br/>Your hair is as a flock of goats,
            <br/>that descend from Mount Gilead.
            <br/><strong>2</strong> Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,
            <br/>which have come up from the washing,
            <br/>where every one of them has twins.
            <br/>None is bereaved among them.
            <br/><strong>3</strong> Your lips are like scarlet thread.
            <br/>Your mouth is lovely.
            <br/>Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
            <br/><strong>4</strong> Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory,
            <br/>on which a thousand shields hang,
            <br/>all the shields of the mighty men.
            <br/><strong>5</strong> Your two breasts are like two fawns
            <br/>that are twins of a roe,
            <br/>which feed among the lilies.
            <br/>
            <br/><strong>6</strong> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,
            <br/>I will go to the mountain of myrrh,
            <br/>to the hill of frankincense.
            <br/>
            <br/><strong>7</strong> You are all beautiful, my love.
            <br/>There is no spot in you.
            <br/><strong>8</strong> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
            <br/>with me from Lebanon.
            <br/>Look from the top of Amana,
            <br/>from the top of Senir and Hermon,
            <br/>from the lions' dens,
            <br/>from the mountains of the leopards. - Song of Solomon 4:1-8
        </p>
        <p>
            It is obvious by reading these things that the man is admiring his bride's beauty and there is sexual 
            desire.  Once again, in the place these things are written, you will not find "this thing displeased the 
            Lord" or any evidence of a sacrifice for sin.

            <br/>The best among ten thousand.
            <br/><strong>11</strong> His head is like the purest gold.
            <br/>His hair is bushy, black as a raven.
            <br/><strong>12</strong> His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,
            <br/>washed with milk, mounted like jewels.
            <br/><strong>13</strong> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.
            <br/>His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.

            <br/>His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
            <br/><strong>16</strong> His mouth is sweetness;
            <br/>yes, he is altogether lovely.
            <br/>This is my beloved, and this is my friend,

        <p>
            As you can see, the woman also admires the man, and this is not sinning, either.
        </p>
        <p>
            As further proof that adultery is not the same as other types of sexual sin, let us consider what God says 
            concerning unmarried people having sex (in the event it isn't rape; rape was also punished by death):
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>16</strong> "If a man entices a virgin who isn't pledged to be married, and lies with her, he shall 
            surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. <strong>17</strong> If her father utterly refuses to give her to
            him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. - Exodus 22:16-17
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>28</strong> If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her and
            lies with her, and they are found, <strong>29</strong> then the man who lay with her shall give to the 
            lady's father fifty shekels of silver. She shall be his wife, because he has humbled her. He may not put her
            away all his days. - Deuteronomy 22:28-29
        </p>
        <p>
            This conduct is obviously wrong, and as a result, the man was supposed to marry the woman he seduced and 
            violated.  However, this was not something punished by death, as was always the case with adultery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now let us consider the case of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman, but the woman is betrothed to him:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>36</strong> But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is
            past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin. Let them
            marry. <strong>37</strong> But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no urgency, but has power over
            his own will, and has determined in his own heart to keep his own virgin, does well. <strong>38</strong> So 
            then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does 
            better. - 1 Corinthians 7:36-38
        </p>
        <p>
            So we can see that because of the "improper behavior," the man should marry his betrothed if "his passions 
            are strong, and it has to be".  Once again, the solution is for the person to marry the other individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason I bring these things up is to set my brothers at ease about looking for a wife in the same way 
            that this has been done for the last few thousand years (see an attractive woman, pursue her, fall in love, 
            and get married).  The reason it has been done this way is because God designed it this way.  This letter
            is written from my perspective, which is the male perspective.  However, it is just as important for a
            woman to be attracted to her husband as it is for a husband to be attracted to his wife.

    <!-- FALSE TEACHINGS -->
    <section>
        <h2>False Teachings</h2>
        <p>
            I have read books and studies that imply that an unmarried man looking at an unmarried woman and being 
            attracted to her is adultery.  Aside from redefining the word adultery, this teaching would have very 
            significant implications:  we may be single, we can be currently married, but we cannot look for a wife who 
            is attractive to us, because by doing so, we sin against God.  If we are persistent in looking for a wife 
            who is attractive to us, we would be by definition living in sin, and the church would have every right to 
            discipline or expel us, or even regard us as unbelievers.  Because forced marriages aren't done anymore, the 
            only two options would be to never look for a wife, or to pursue someone we aren't attracted to at all (the 
            greater the attraction, the greater the temptation to sin).  For everyone, the temptation to sin sexually 
            would be constant, because they wouldn't be married to someone they are interested in.  Obviously, this 
            opposes God's design for marriage.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to
            seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, <strong>2</strong> through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,
            branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron, <strong>3</strong> forbidding marriage and commanding
            to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the
            truth. <strong>4</strong> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is
            received with thanksgiving. <strong>5</strong> For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. 
            - 1 Timothy 4:1-5
        </p>
        <p>
            Although a rule against looking for a wife you're attracted to doesn't explicitly prohibit marriage, it only
            stops one step short:  It prohibits people from doing the things they need to do in order to get married in
            a marriage that is according to God's design.
        </p>
        <p>
            After looking closely at the scriptures, I can see that this teaching is false, and I hope you can see so
            too.  If you believed this way or are under this teaching, I hope this helps you see God's perfect design
            for marriage and gives you a defense for when you want to look for a spouse.  No man or woman should ever 
            feel guilty for pursuing a spouse they are physically attracted to.

    <!-- MARRIAGE - A PICTURE OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH -->
    <section>
        <h2>Marriage - A Picture of Christ and the Church</h2>
        <p>
            Marriage is a picture of Christ and the Church.  For people who have the desire to do this, when they fall
            in love and get married, they become part of the bigger picture.  We catch glimpses of this mystery
            throughout the scripture.  Consider what Isaiah prophesied concerning Israel:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace,
            <br/>and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest,
            <br/>until her righteousness shines out like the dawn,
            <br/>and her salvation like a burning lamp.
            <br/><strong>2</strong> The nations will see your righteousness,
            <br/>and all kings your glory.
            <br/>You will be called by a new name,
            <br/>which Yahweh's mouth will name.
            <br/><strong>3</strong> You will also be a crown of beauty in Yahweh's hand,
            <br/>and a royal diadem in your God's hand.
            <br/><strong>4</strong> You will not be called Forsaken any more,
            <br/>nor will your land be called Desolate any more;
            <br/>but you will be called Hephzibah,
            <br/>and your land Beulah;
            <br/>for Yahweh delights in you,
            <br/>and your land will be married.
            <br/><strong>5</strong> For as a young man marries a virgin,
            <br/>so your sons will marry you.
            <br/>As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride,
            <br/>so your God will rejoice over you. - Isaiah 62:1-5
        </p>
        <p>
            Or the marriage supper of the Lamb:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>6</strong> I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters,
            and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!
            <strong>7</strong> Let's rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let's give the glory to him. For the wedding
            of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready." <strong>8</strong> It was given to her that she 
            would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>9</strong> He said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the 
            Lamb.'" He said to me, "These are true words of God."
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>10</strong> I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me, "Look! Don't do it! I am a 
            fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the 
            testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy." - Revelation 19:6-10
        </p>
        <p>
            "Worship God."  Because I have depression, this can be difficult for me to do at times.  I am convinced that
            many of you are suffering as well.  Thankfully, Jesus paid the price for our sins, so no matter what happens
            to us down here or how much we suffer, we will get to be with him at the end:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea
            is no more. <strong>2</strong> I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
            prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. <strong>3</strong> I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying,
            "Behold, God's dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God
            himself will be with them as their God. <strong>4</strong> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. 
            Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have
            passed away." - Revelation 21:1-4
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice how the new Jerusalem is the bride of God?  We see this again a few verses later:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>9</strong> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he
            spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb's bride." <strong>10</strong> He
            carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming
            down out of heaven from God, <strong>11</strong> having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious
            stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal; <strong>12</strong> having a great and high wall;
            having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the
            twelve tribes of the children of Israel. <strong>13</strong> On the east were three gates; and on the north
            three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. <strong>14</strong> The wall of the 
            city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.
            - Revelation 21:9-14
        </p>
        <p>
            Paul sums up the relationship between Christ and the Church like this:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>22</strong> Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. <strong>23</strong> For the
            husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of
            the body. <strong>24</strong> But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their 
            own husbands in everything.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            <strong>25</strong> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up
            for it; <strong>26</strong> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the
            word, <strong>27</strong> that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or
            wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect. <strong>28</strong> Even so
            husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.
            <strong>29</strong> For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord
            also does the assembly; <strong>30</strong> because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.
            <strong>31</strong> "For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife.
            Then the two will become one flesh." ... <strong>32</strong> This mystery is great, but I speak concerning
            Christ and of the assembly. <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as
            himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband. - Ephesians 5:22-33
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many more scriptures which defend marriage, but this should give you a doctrinally sound defense
            when you start looking for a significant other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although marriage is important for those who desire it, the most important thing is to believe in Jesus.
            Jesus did what we can never do -- He lived a perfect life (2 Corinthians 5:21), and then paid the price for
            all the sins people will ever commit (Isaiah 53, John 1:29-30).  It is by believing in Jesus that we are
            saved (John 3:16-18, John 5:24, John 6:35, Acts 10:43, Romans 10:9-13), because all of us are sinners
            (Psalm 53, Romans 3:9-20), and God requires perfection (Matthew 5:48).  Let us share the good news of the
            Gospel because our time here is short (1 Corinthians 7:29-31).
